String : =>
     Immutable → once created, its value cannot be changed.
      Stored in String Constant Pool (helps save memory for duplicate strings).

StringBuffer :=>
      Mutable → can change its value without creating new object.
      Thread-safe → methods are synchronized, safe in multithreading.

StringBuilder :=>
     Same as StringBuffer, but not thread-safe.
     Slightly faster because no synchronization.
