                              UML basics (optional but useful)

Association represents a relationship between two classes, showing that one class uses or is connected to another.

Itâ€™s like a mathematical relation:
                                     One-to-one
                                     One-to-many
                                     Many-to-many
1. Association:=>>
    Definition:      A loose relationship between two classes.

Characteristics:
                     One class uses another class.
                     No ownership; objects can exist independently.

2. Aggregation: =>>
   Definition:       A has-a relationship with weak ownership.

Characteristics:
                    The contained object can exist independently of the parent.

3. Composition
   Definition:       A strong has-a relationship with ownership.

Characteristics:
                     The contained object cannot exist without the parent.
