 Relationship b/w classes 
                              Association, Aggregation, Composition
                              UML basics (optional but useful)

Association represents a relationship between two classes, showing that one class uses or is connected to another.

Itâ€™s like a mathematical relation:
                                     One-to-one
                                     One-to-many
                                     Many-to-many
1. Association:=>>
    Definition:      A loose relationship between two classes.

Characteristics:
                     One class uses another class.
                     No ownership; objects can exist independently.

2. Aggregation: =>>
   Definition:       A has-a relationship with weak ownership.

Characteristics:
                    The contained object can exist independently of the parent.

3. Composition
   Definition:       A strong has-a relationship with ownership.

Characteristics:
                     The contained object cannot exist without the parent.

                                                                                   Relationships Between Classes

In object-oriented programming (OOP), classes often interact with each other. The cardinality of a relationship describes how many objects of one class can be associated with objects of another class.

1. One-to-One Relationship: =>         Meaning: Each object of Class A is related to exactly one object of Class B, and vice versa.

                              Example:
                                     A Passport belongs to one Person.
                                     One Person can have only one Passport.

2. One-to-Many Relationship: =>        Meaning: One object of Class A can be related to multiple objects of Class B, but each Class B object is related to only one object of Class A.

                              Example:

                                   A Teacher can teach many Students.
                                   But each Student has only one Teacher (in this simplified example).
