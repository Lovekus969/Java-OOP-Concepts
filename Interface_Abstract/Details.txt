        What is an Interface?

                              In Java (and in OOP generally), an interface is like a contract or blueprint that defines what methods a class must have, but not how they are implemented.
                              It only specifies the method signatures (name, return type, parameters).
                              No implementation details inside (except for default and static methods after Java 8).
                              A class that uses (implements) an interface must provide the method bodies.
