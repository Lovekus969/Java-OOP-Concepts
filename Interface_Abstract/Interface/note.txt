What is an Interface?

An interface in Java is like a contract or blueprint for classes.
It tells:
 “Any class that implements me MUST provide implementations for my methods.”
                                                         
        Key Points about Interfaces   ==>>
                                      Declared using the interface keyword Can contain:
                                      Abstract methods (no body, just signatures).
                                      Default methods (with body, introduced in Java 8).
                                      Static methods (with body).
                                      Constants (public static final by default).
                                      A class implements an interface (not extends).
                                      A class can implement multiple interfaces → this is Java’s way of supporting multiple inheritance.
                                      You cannot create objects of an interface.
