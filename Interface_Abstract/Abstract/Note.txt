Abstract class works like a superclass

    It can have abstract methods (must be overridden in child classes).
    It can have normal methods (subclasses can directly use them, just like in a normal superclass).
    It cannot be instantiated directly (you canâ€™t do new Animal() if Animal is abstract).
