What is Inheritance?

Definition: In OOP, inheritance is when one class acquires the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class.
Purpose: Promotes code reuse and represents "is-a" relationships.




What is Polymorphism?

Definition: The ability of an object to take many forms â€” the same method name can behave differently based on the object calling it.

            Two Types:
                        Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
                        Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

Method Overloading (Compile-time)                           ( trick is L -> Compile)

            Same method name, different parameter list.
