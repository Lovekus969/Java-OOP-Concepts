This repository contains a detailed explanation of the key differences between method overloading and method overriding in Java. It includes:

Master OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming) in Java — clean, sharp, and industry-level


4 Pillars of OOP in Java

Encapsulation  it helps	binding data & methods in one class	 . e.g:Medicine capsule – holds drug inside
Abstraction  it helps		: Hiding complexity, showing only essentials	. e.g: Car dashboard – you press "start," not worry about the engine
Inheritance: One class inherits properties from another.  e.g, 	Child inherits traits from parents
Polymorphism: Same action behaves differently in different contexts	e.g , person acts differently at home and work


Static Nested Class:=>
            Declared with the static keyword inside another class.
            Can access only static members of the outer class.
            Acts like a normal top-level class but is scoped inside the outer class.
Inner Class (Non-static)
            Belongs to an instance of the outer class.
            Can access both instance and static members of the outer class.
            Requires an instance of the outer class to be created.
Anonymous Inner Class
            A class without a name.
            Used for one-time use (often with interfaces or abstract classes).
