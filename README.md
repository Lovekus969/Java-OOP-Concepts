4 Pillars of OOP in Java

Encapsulation  it helps	binding data & methods in one class	 . e.g:Medicine capsule – holds drug inside
Abstraction  it helps		: Hiding complexity, showing only essentials	. e.g: Car dashboard – you press "start," not worry about the engine
Inheritance: One class inherits properties from another.  e.g, 	Child inherits traits from parents
Polymorphism: Same action behaves differently in different contexts	e.g , person acts differently at home and work
