Q.. 1 What is a Constructor?
 Ans : - A constructor is a special method in a class used to initialize objects.
        Name of constructor = Name of class
        No return type (not even void)
        Automatically called when an object is created

Types of Constructors
a) Default Constructor
No parameters
 If you donâ€™t define any constructor, Java provides a default constructor automatically

b) Parameterized Constructor
Takes arguments to initialize an object

c) Copy Constructor (not built-in like C++, but can implement in Java)
Creates a new object by copying another object

 Key Points: - >
           Constructor cannot have a return type
           Automatically called when object is created
           You can overload constructors in the same class

Q .What is super?
       Super is a reference to the parent class (superclass).
It is used to:
        Call the parent class constructor
        Access parent class methods
        Access parent class variables

Super in Constructors has another meaning .
When a child class is created, it can call the constructor of its parent class using super(...).This ensures the parent class is properly initialized before the child class adds its own data.
