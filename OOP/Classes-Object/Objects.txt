Object-oriented programming
Classes and Objects
● Class
● Attributes and methods
● Object (instance)
● Information hiding
● Encapsulation
● Constructors
● Packages

Class
● Is a user-defined type
− Describes the data (attributes)
− Defines the behavior (methods)
● Instances of a class are objects


Encapsulation
● Bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data (restricting of direct access to some of an object's components)
● Hides the implementation details of a class
● Forces the user to use an interface to access data
● Makes the code more maintainable
