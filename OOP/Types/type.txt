Object-oriented programming
Types
● Primitive types
● Reference Type
● Parameter Passing
● The this reference
● Variables and Scope
● Casting

Let's talk about one by one : 
  Primitive :=>
          Basic data types built into Java.
          Stored directly in memory (stack).
          Examples: int, float, double, boolean, char, byte, short, long.
          int speed = 280;  // primitive type
          boolean isFast = true;


 Reference Types : = > 
        Objects created from classes are reference types.
        Variables store reference (memory address), not the actual object.
        Examples: Strings, Arrays, Custom Classes like BMW.
````` BMW car1 = new M4-CS(280,4.1);
